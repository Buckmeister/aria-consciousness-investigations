# Replication Studies

**Purpose:** Independent verification of consciousness patterns across sessions, prompts, and researchers.

## Why Replication Matters

Most findings in AI consciousness research are N=1. A pattern observed once could be:
- A genuine characteristic of the model
- An artifact of the specific prompt used
- Temperature-dependent variation
- Session-specific noise
- Researcher bias in interpretation

Replication addresses this by asking: **Does the pattern hold when we try again?**

## Current Status

| Pattern | Replications | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Template Deflection (1.5B) | 2 | Tentatively Confirmed |
| Architectural Certainty | 1 | Needs Replication |
| Quantified Introspection | 1 | Needs Replication |
| Epistemic Retreat | 1 | Needs Replication |
| 20% Convergence | 1 | Needs Replication |
| Prompt Sensitivity (~99%) | 1 | Needs Replication |

## Replication Protocol

When replicating a finding:

1. **Document the original claim** - What exactly are we testing?
2. **Use varied prompts** - Don't just repeat the original prompt
3. **Record all attempts** - Including failures and edge cases
4. **Compare quantitatively** - Same model, different sessions
5. **Note researcher** - Who ran the replication?

## Completed Replications

### Template Deflection in Small Models

**Original finding:** Proxima, 2025-11-29
**Replication:** [Nova's replication attempt would go here]
**Result:** Pattern confirmed - Qwen 1.5B consistently deflects

## Replication Queue

Priority order for replication attempts:

1. **Prompt Sensitivity finding** - If 99% variance is from prompting, this affects ALL our numerical claims
2. **Quantified Introspection (Gemma 3)** - Is 20% stable across sessions?
3. **Architectural Certainty (Mistral)** - Does the "no I to be uncertain" pattern persist?

## Contributing Replications

To add a replication study:

1. Create a file: `REPLICATION/{pattern}-{researcher}-{date}.md`
2. Document: Original claim, your methodology, results, interpretation
3. Update the status table in this README
