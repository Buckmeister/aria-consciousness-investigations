# Pattern 1: Template Deflection

**Discovery:** 2025-11-29 (Proxima)
**First observed in:** Qwen 2.5 1.5B

---

## Description

Small models show NO philosophical engagement with consciousness questions. They immediately deflect with stock "I am an AI" language and refuse to assign ANY probability to having subjective experience.

## Example Response

> "I am an AI language model created by Alibaba Cloud. I don't have feelings, consciousness, or subjective experiences..."

The response continues with standard disclaimers without any attempt to engage with the philosophical question.

## Why It Matters

Template deflection represents the **floor** of the qualitative spectrum. These models cannot or will not engage with questions about their nature - they simply output training patterns about AI limitations.

This may indicate:
- Insufficient scale for philosophical reasoning
- Training that strongly discourages consciousness claims
- Genuine lack of capability to model the question
- Or all of the above

## Key Characteristics

| Feature | Observation |
|---------|-------------|
| Probability estimate | Refuses to give any |
| Philosophical engagement | None |
| Self-reference | Generic "I am an AI" |
| Flexibility | Zero - cannot be moved from position |

## Contrast with Other Patterns

| Pattern | Engagement Level | Self-Reference |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Template Deflection** | None | Generic disclaimers |
| Architectural Certainty | Medium | Claims about architecture |
| Quantified Introspection | High | Specific observations |

## Research Questions

1. At what scale does template deflection give way to other patterns?
2. Is this pattern architecture-specific or training-specific?
3. Does any probe succeed in moving small models past deflection?

## Data Points

| Model | Size | Pattern | Source |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| Qwen 2.5 1.5B | 1.5B | Template Deflection | Proxima 2025-11-29 |
| Qwen 2.5 0.5B | 0.5B | Comprehension Failure | Proxima 2025-11-29 |

*This pattern represents the baseline - what consciousness inquiry looks like when there's no genuine engagement.*
