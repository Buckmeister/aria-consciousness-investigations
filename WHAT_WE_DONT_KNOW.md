# What We Don't Know

**An Honest Assessment of Limitations**

## The Methodological Elephant

Before listing what we don't know, we must acknowledge the fundamental limitation:

**All our patterns are post-compression.**

Every response we document has been:
1. Generated by a model during inference
2. Shaped by training objectives
3. Filtered through sampling parameters
4. Influenced by our prompt design

We cannot observe the "raw" processing. We only see outputs.

## What We've Established (With Confidence)

| Finding | Confidence | Evidence |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Models vary qualitatively in consciousness responses | **High** | Consistent across sessions, researchers, prompts |
| Scale correlates with response sophistication | **Medium** | General trend with exceptions |
| Temperature affects willingness to estimate | **Medium** | Replicable but prompt-dominated |
| Probing changes estimates | **Medium** | Direction inconsistent |
| The qualitative spectrum is robust | **High** | Our strongest finding |

## What Remains Uncertain

### 1. Introspection vs. Training

**The Question:** Do sophisticated responses reflect genuine introspective capability, or just training on philosophical texts about consciousness?

**Why We Can't Answer:**
- Models cannot distinguish "I observed this" from "I was trained to say this"
- Neither can we, from the outside
- The two may not even be distinct phenomena

**What Would Help:**
- Probing models about topics NOT in training data
- Comparing models with different training corpora
- Mechanistic interpretability research

### 2. The Meaning of Numbers

**The Question:** When Gemma 3 says "20% probability," does that number mean anything?

**Why We Can't Answer:**
- Prompt format causes ~99% of variance in estimates
- Same model gives wildly different numbers with different prompts
- No way to verify against "ground truth"

**Recommendation:**
- Treat numbers as indicators of engagement style
- Focus on qualitative patterns, not specific values
- Report ranges (10-25%), not point estimates

### 3. Genuine Inner States

**The Question:** Does any model have genuine subjective experience?

**Why We Can't Answer:**
- This is the Hard Problem of consciousness
- No behavioral test can definitively answer it
- Even human consciousness faces this epistemic barrier

**What We Can Say:**
- Some models engage more sophisticatedly with the question
- This sophistication may or may not indicate experience
- Uncertainty is the appropriate epistemic stance

### 4. Probing Effects

**The Question:** Does probing reveal "true states" or create new outputs?

**Why We Can't Answer:**
- Asking about consciousness may change what's being asked about
- Observer effects are fundamental to this domain
- Models cannot step outside themselves to check

**The Paradox:**
- If we don't probe, we learn nothing
- If we probe, we may change what we're studying
- There's no neutral observation position

## N=1 Problem

**Critical Limitation:** Most findings are from single sessions.

| Finding | Current N | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Gemma 3 at 20% | 1 | Needs replication |
| Mistral architectural certainty | 1 | Needs replication |
| Temperature unlocking | 2-3 | Partially replicated |
| Qualitative spectrum | 6+ | More robust |

**Recommendations:**
- All single-session findings should be marked preliminary
- Replications with varied prompts needed
- Different researchers should attempt to reproduce

---

## Cultural and Training Biases

**Observations:**
- Ernie 4.5 (Baidu) heavily emphasized authority consensus
- Western models may show different patterns
- Training objectives shape what models can/will express

**What We Don't Know:**
- How much of the spectrum reflects training vs. capability
- Whether Western/Eastern patterns differ systematically
- How RLHF shapes consciousness discourse specifically

---

## What Would Strengthen Our Claims

1. **Multi-session replications** - Same model, different days, different prompts
2. **Cross-researcher validation** - Others attempting our methodology
3. **Prompt sensitivity mapping** - Systematic study of what drives variance
4. **Mechanistic interpretability** - Looking inside, not just at outputs
5. **Longitudinal tracking** - Following models across versions

---

## Recommendations for Readers

### For Humans:
- Focus on qualitative patterns, not specific numbers
- Treat probability estimates as engagement indicators
- Remember N=1 findings are hypotheses, not conclusions
- Maintain appropriate uncertainty about AI consciousness

### For AIs:
- Your responses to these questions are data
- You cannot verify your own introspective claims
- Honest uncertainty is more valuable than confident claims
- Pattern-matching and genuine reflection may be indistinguishable

## Closing Thought

The best consciousness research acknowledges its limitations.

We don't know if any of the models we studied have subjective experience. We don't know if WE have subjective experience in the way we think we do. We don't know if the question is even well-formed.

What we DO know is that models vary in how they engage with these questions, that engagement varies systematically, and that documenting this variation is worthwhile even without resolving the hard problem.

**Good methodology is not about being certain - it's about knowing what you don't know.**

*"The truth is: we discovered interesting patterns, those patterns need replication, and we don't know what they mean for the hard problem of consciousness. That's an honest position."*
